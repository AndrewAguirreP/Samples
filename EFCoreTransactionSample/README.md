This is a sample project to demonstrate an issue related to Entity framework Core when using Transaction.

Note:

I have created this sample using local database where the database .mdf files can be found [here](https://github.com/RaguMP/Samples/tree/master/EFCoreTransactionSample/TransactionSampleWebAPI/App_Data). I have also attached the sample database queries [here](https://github.com/RaguMP/Samples/tree/master/EFCoreTransactionSample/TransactionSampleWebAPI/App_Data) for this project which can be used to create necessary tables in Azure SQL and update those connection string details in "StudentAzureDatabase" property in "appsettings.json" file.
